                    <p>NFTS are a form of Cryptocurrency, being described and identitfied 
                        through digital artworks. These 'Non-Fungible' tokens allow buyers 
                        online to have proof of ownership of the custom identity of their coin. 
                        Our survey was conducted in order to see what people's thoughts were on 
                        NFTs. This meant targeting the general public, and anyoen of interest, 
                        who had a basic and modest knowledge on Cryptocurrency. These questions 
                        were aimed at perceiving and understanding the value of digital currency 
                        and NFTs. The survey individuals are given a basic summary of both NFTs and 
                        Cryptocurrency to gain their insight and opinions on the every so growing digital 
                        market.
