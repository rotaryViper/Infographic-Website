            <h2>EVALUATION OF DATA</h2>
            <p>
                The opinion of NFTs is somewhat different from cryptocurrency. While roughly half of the respondents would buy or invest in cryptocurrency, only 19% would buy an NFT. Furthermore, half of the respondents do not approve of the rapid growth of NFTs; this is when mentioning the environmental costs of NFT transactions. Overall, many people are familiar with cryptocurrency and NFTs. However, people would prefer to invest in cryptocurrency coins compared to NFTs.
