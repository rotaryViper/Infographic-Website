                NFTs are a form of cryptocurrency built differently from regular coins and have boomed in popularity in 2021. These non-fungible tokens allow buyers online to have proof of ownership in a world where things are copied and pasted and people feign right of possession unless copyrighted.
                <br><br>
                At its core, NFTs are a logical step to bring security to digital assets but their popularity is something steeped in controversy. One problem is linked to cryptocurrency as a whole which is the economical and environmental damages caused by NFTs, the lack of sustainability matching with its rise in usage leaves many observers concerned. Another is the lack of regularity in NFTs when recognising how large of a transaction can be made. NFTs are known to have the potential to reach prices in the billions and a lack of a formal process leads to potential scams on the side of the dealer or buyer.
                <br><br> 
                Our survey was conducted in order to see what people’s thoughts are for NFTs. This meant targeting the general public who have a modest knowledge of the internet. Our questions are aimed at how people perceive NFTs as a trend and product as well as their existence economically as an investment, it asks questions about cryptocurrency first to establish a baseline before moving onto NFTs. The survey also informed respondents what cryptocurrency and NFTs were in case they were unsure about its details.
